# Link-It
__The main idea behind Link-It app is very simple . It makes any kind of link clickable . Say you have copied a link from word pad and paste it in somewhere like in any forum and unfortunately found that it's not  clickable . It just appears to be a plain text . So Link-It will help you to convert it to a clickable link.__
